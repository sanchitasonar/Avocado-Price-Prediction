The project was completed as part of my Master’s coursework in Business Forecasting, where I analyzed historical avocado price data to build a time series forecasting model using the Prophet library in Python. The objective was to identify trends and seasonal patterns in price fluctuations and generate future price predictions based on historical data. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and structured according to Prophet’s required format before training the model. The analysis included exploratory data visualization, trend decomposition, and forecasting with confidence intervals. The project demonstrates practical experience in time series analysis, data preprocessing, and model interpretation using tools such as Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Prophet. Additionally, as a separate mini project, I developed a command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python to strengthen my understanding of programming fundamentals, including conditional logic, functions, and input validation.
